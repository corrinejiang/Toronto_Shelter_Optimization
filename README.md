# Optimization Challenge for Toronto Shelter

Group 12: Yi Kuang, Kexin Wang, Corrine(Yingxin) Jiang, Mesaye Bahiru

We know homelessness has a devastating impact on any city, and in Toronto, more than 30,000 women, men and children crowd into the city’s homeless shelters annually. Many thousands more sleep on the streets or join the ranks of the “hidden homeless”. There are about 70,000 households on Toronto’s social housing waiting list. In addition, on the brink of homelessness, are 150,000 households paying more than half their income on shelter. What's more important is homelessness has been growing rapidly, almost six times faster than the overall population. In 1960, there were 900 beds in the city’s shelter system and 1.6 million people living in Toronto. By now, Toronto had around 7000 shelter beds in a city of 2.6 million. The face of homelessness is changing as more families and children line-up for shelter. Due to the extreme weather, the demand for shelters has dramatically increased during the cold winter in Toronto.

What we want to solve for the shelter question is based on the limited resources and budget. Some areas within the city, the demands for the shelters are beyond capacity, however, some of the shelters barely have homeless people to visit. We considered the allocation problem firstly, but lacking detailed information about the route of homelessness, they normally randomly scatter around the city, and could not detect them in time. Therefore, we choose to focus on the cost side. The city of Toronto has to build more shelters and provide beds for the excess needs, while at the same time, the shelters still need a relatively high operation cost for the empty spot. Therefore, the cost of building new shelters and maintenance will be considered in our analysis, and we would like to use Gurobi as our main tool to do that analysis. The main goal is minimizing the total cost associated with existing and new shelters the city plans to build.
